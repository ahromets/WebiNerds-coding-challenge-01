Today's task is to implement an intersection function for 2 *sorted* arrays. You can do it 2 ways:
1. function is easy to read/understand
2. function is efficient. In this case explain it's efficiency using Big O notation.

```javascript
console.log(intersection([1,2,3,4,5], [2,4,8]));
=> [2,4]
```
